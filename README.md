# minmal-router

A very simple and minimal router for PHP. Routing is 
done with regular expressions.

## Install:

    composer require diversen/minimal-router

## Usage: 

See [index.php](index.php) which adds two routes. 

You can run the built-in PHP server in `minimal-router/`
which will run the example. 

See [test.php](test.php) which holds the `actions`
for the two routes.
